,`*DOMAIN QUESTIONNAIRE*`,

1. List 10 available domains (use http://iwantmyname.com) you think would be appropriate for your site:

  etsicimori.com / etsicimori.co / etsicimori.net / etsicimori.org / etsicimori.us / etsicimori.link / etsicimori.eu / etsicimori.co.uk / etsicimori.link / etsicimori.jp
  
2. What type or genre of domain is this? (Ex. Game, Toy, Greeting Card Generator, Creative Tool, Political Pamphlet, Archive)

  Mystery adventure game
  
3. Write a small story (one paragraph or so) that details a user's experience of discovering your domain, visiting it within a particular context (like mobile, desktop, while hungry, at a funeral, etc.), experiencing what it has to offer, and subsequently leaving.

  Ruka discovers the site etsicimori through the link a friend sends her through chat and goes to check it out. Her friend tells her they found it while randomly surfing the internet for sites to pass the time, and recommends she try it out. Ruka opens the link to first face the home page of the site with its simple pixel style game interface, and clicks on the play button. The site opens to a page with an image of a square room, with some items scattered around, a character, and a door. On the side of the page are a few buttons with options for actions to take such as 'open the door'. She goes through the game by clicking on options and using the captions that run on the bottom of the page as guides to how to clear the game. After finishing the story, she finds that there is more to the game and that a certain command has to be typed upon loading the home page. After doing so and going through the rest, she is satified and decides to tell her friend what she thought of it. Mobile version not available.
  
4. Would somebody return to your domain after visiting it for the first time - in how long do you think - and why?

  Maybe, possibly after a few months. To play through again if interested.
  
5. List some 'stuff' that your site 'does'. (Be detailed)

  Changing backgrounds, click interaction, storytelling, advancing options (different routes), random facts.

1) http://www.anasomnia.com - An illustrative flash video(?) with a interactive start and endless continuation until it is reset.

2) http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html - Displays the solar system as pixels, makes you think about how small things can seem.

3) http://app.coolors.co - Color site that helps chose a limited color palette by random selection.
